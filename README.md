# IITR_CMLab
Project of Summer Internship'22 | CMLab, IIT Roorkee
## Files
**main.py**: This is a python file to run our application/GUI. This file runs using different modules made in @modules file

**modules**: These are different python modules which are imported in main.py for working of GUI

**main.ui**: Qt designer file. This is made inside Qt creator/designer. The exported file generates .ui file which is then converted to .py file. ui_main.py is the python file converted from this .ui file.

**themes**: This file contains different themes for out GUI

**images**: This file contains different images used in making of our GUI

**dist**: This file contains the executable(.exe) form of our GUI. 

**icon.ico**: This is a central icon of our project

**modules/ui_functions.py**: Functions related to GUI

**modules/ui_main.py**: Qt designer exports .ui file which contains xml code. To make xml code editable we convert that to .py file using **pyuic6 -o output.py -x input.ui**   Here, pyuic6 is because we are using pyqt6. -o is followed by python file we want to get output as. And -x is followed by input file which is in .ui file.

## Process to convert .py to .exe
Step1: In CMD: **pip install pyinstaller**

Step2: In project directory(make sure all the necessary files are in this directory): **pyinstaller --onefile -w filename.py** ,(filename.py=main.py in our case). This will create some files in project directory

Step3: Open dist file to get executable(.exe) file for use

## Process to convert .ui file of Qt to editable .py file
.ui file is xml file and we canâ€™t modify that to our need. We therefore convert this .ui file to .py file and modify according to our need. 
To modify, 

Step1: Open cmd at the .ui file location. (UI file will be created inside the project folder)

Step2: Now inside cmd use: **pyuic6 -o output.py -x input.ui**    
       Here, pyuic6 is because we are using pyqt6. -o is followed by python file we want to get output as. And -x is followed by input file which is in .ui file.
       
Step3: Open project file, .py file will be available as (output.py)
